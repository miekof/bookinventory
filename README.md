# Book Inventory System for Books for Women in Prison 
This is a part of break out groups at [Chi Hack Night](http://www.chihacknight.org).

## Problems and Solutions
[Chicago Books For Women in Prison](https://chicagobwp.org/) receives many books as donations. It takes a lot of human power to organize them; entering books in the database so that they are searchable when a request is submitted. This is currently done by manually entering all the information. In order to speed up the process, the organization wants to scan bar code and filling some of the information automatically based on ISBN.

## Previous work
We have worked on the performance of major book search API's. Please refer [Book API Test](https://github.com/miekof/books)
