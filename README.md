# Book Inventory System for Books for Women in Prison 
## Problems and Solutions
[Chicago Books For Women in Prison](https://chicagobwp.org/) receives many books as donations. It takes a lot of human power to organize them; entering books in the database so that they are searchable when a request is submitted. This is currently done by manually entering all the information. In order to speed up the process, the organization wants to scan bar code and filling some of the information automatically based on ISBN.
